# icse_java_manim-code
This repository contains the manim code of my youtube videos for the course ["Learn JAVA"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaskoKWGLbE_u35ra2gdFg1iJktrVUK4).

This almost entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).  See also the community maintained version at [ManimCommunity](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/).
